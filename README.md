# HealthConnect: A Patient-Controlled Health Record Platform

**Simplifying health data, amplifying patient care.** HealthConnect is a web application designed to create a single, unified health narrative controlled by the patient.

## The Problem

Our healthcare system is built on a paradox: care is more specialized than ever, yet patient information remains trapped in disconnected silos. This fragmentation breaks the continuum of care, leading to gaps in treatment, redundant testing, and poor coordination between providers. A patient's health journey becomes a series of isolated snapshots with no single, continuous narrative.

Healthcare doesn't need another new data standard. It needs a better, more secure process built on the standards we already trust.

## Our Solution: HealthConnect

HealthConnect is a patient-controlled, longitudinal health record platform that operates on the pillars of modern healthcare IT: **FHIR** for data interoperability and **HIPAA** principles for privacy and security.

We are not reinventing the wheel; we are building a collaborative and transparent road for it. HealthConnect transforms a patient's record from a static file into a living document that evolves with their health journey.

## Key Features

* **Patient-Controlled Records:** Patients are the curators of their own health story, with the power to grant and manage access for their providers.
* **Unified Health Narrative:** Verified clinicians can securely append treatment notes, prescriptions, and lab results, creating a single, chronological record.
* **Seamless Provider Collaboration:** Breaks down the communication wall between specialists and primary care physicians, providing a holistic view of the patient's journey.
* **Built on Trusted Standards:** Leverages the FHIR standard for data interoperability, ensuring data is structured, secure, and understandable across different systems.
* **Secure & Private:** Designed with HIPAA principles at its core to ensure patient data is protected.

## User Experience & Design
